# Java Behavioral Design Patterns

    

- **Mediator pattern** : Used to permit object interactions without using explicit object
  references
- **Memento pattern** : Saves an object's current internal state as a memento so that it can be referred to and restored to
- **Interpreter pattern** : Used to establish a grammatical representation and an
  interpreter that interprets language
- **Iterator pattern** : Grants access to an object's members without sharing the
  encapsulated data structures
- **Chain of responsibility pattern** : An object submits a request to multiple objects without knowing which object will handle the request
- **Command pattern:** Permits the sending of requests without knowing details
  about the receiver or even about what is being requested
- **State pattern** : Allows an object to change its behavior based on internal state
  changes
- **Strategy pattern** : Allows us to individually encapsulate a set of interchangeable
  algorithms
- **Observer pattern** : Updates subscriber objects when a change is made to the
  publisher object's state
- **Null object pattern** : Negates the need to search for the null condition
- **Template method pattern**: Involves creating an algorithm template with
  processing steps relegated to child classes
- **Visitor pattern**: Performs operations on an object without altering its structure
